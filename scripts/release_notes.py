"""Release notes from the commit bodies, because that is where the reasons are.

`gh release --generate-notes` lists pull request titles. This history is
written to be read — Conventional Commits with a body explaining *why* — so
generated notes that throw the body away discard the most useful part of it.

    python scripts/release_notes.py                 # since the last tag
    python scripts/release_notes.py --since v0.1.0
    python scripts/release_notes.py --version 0.2.0 > notes.md

**The lead paragraph, not the whole body.** Bodies here run to thirty lines
with measurements and repro output; a release note that inlined them would be
unreadable. The first paragraph is the claim, and the rest is the evidence for
anyone who follows the hash — which is what a commit link is for.

Merge commits are dropped: a squashed PR carries the same subject with none of
the body, so keeping both would print every entry twice.
